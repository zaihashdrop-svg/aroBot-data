About Nodes
Can one IP support multiple nodes?
Yes, one IP can support multiple nodes. Just make sure your upload speed can handle it. Rewards depend on bandwidth and performance. An ARO Pod supports up to 100 Mbps, and you can run more if your network allows. 
Why hasn’t my ARO Lite node earned anything after running for an hour?
 Rewards are calculated hourly.
 If your network is stable, you should start seeing rewards within 1–2 hours.
 However, if your network frequently disconnects or changes IP, rewards may be delayed.
Why am I online, but my node shows low rewards?
 At this stage, we're only using a small fraction of your bandwidth to test network connectivity.
 Current rewards displayed are virtual and not final — they're for reference only.
Which port is the ARO Client listening to?
 (We’ll update documentation with this soon — please check back.)
My node doesn’t show up / says "not added" — what should I do?
 If you're using a mobile browser with extensions, it may not be supported.
 We’re working on support for this — stay tuned!
Is there a tutorial for running the ARO Client node?
 Yes! You can find the full guide here:
 👉 ARO Docs – Software Setup
How can I add more nodes?
 Node rewards depend on the bandwidth of each connection.
 If you can provide different networks (e.g., separate IPs or ISPs), you can deploy multiple nodes and bind them to your account.
 All active nodes will show up in your dashboard.
Does adding more nodes increase my Jade and points?
During the Previewnet phase, ordering multiple ARO Pods under a single account will earn you more Jades.
For running ARO Client or ARO Lite, tasks are only counted once per account no matter how many instances you run, you’ll only receive Jades once per node type.
For future phases like Testnet, rewards will scale with the bandwidth and quality of your contribution.
Open ports for different nodes?
The explanations of open ports for ARO Lite/ARO Pod and ARO Link/ARO Client have each been added as a corresponding FAQ at the end of their respective User Guides. https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup

 Why can't I connect to ARO Lite on my phone?
Please note that our ARO Lite is currently not fully optimized for mobile browsers. For the best experience, we recommend accessing it via desktop for now. We’re actively working on mobile compatibility and will notify the community as soon as it’s ready.
How to install node in my MAC/Windows/Linux?
ARO Client is a software image designed for X86 architectures, and this tutorial focuses on a Linux environment.  You would need a virtual machine environment: https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup/
One of our community members has made one, you can use it as a reference: https://youtu.be/JDxlfBEEvIE
Lite node disconnection
If you encounter connection issues with ARO Lite, please try removing the current plugin and reinstalling the latest version 0.0.4 to ensure the best experience.
Or Go to Browser → Extensions, find ARO Lite, and toggle the switch in the bottom right corner off and on — this action should reconnect it.

Why is there so much difference between node lite and node pro?
Very limited impact on your internet experiences for lite node


About Jade
What is the Redeem Code for, and when will I get one?
 Redeem codes will be used in future campaigns and special events.
 Stay tuned — they’ll be released soon!
(2025/7/31)
Is there a limit to how much Jade you can earn per day?
There isn’t an exact number right now because it depends on your referrer. For example, if someone wants to buy 10 pods, they would earn a lot of Jade, or if they referred 1,000 people.

After manually downloaded the latest version 0.0.6 it produce a new serial number, what will happen to the old serial number that had accumulated jades?
The PreviewJade shown in any node is virtual and not actual mining rewards. Real mining will only begin once the Testnet starts. The old data where Jade was accumulated still exists, but please remember it is virtual.

Others
How can I earn rewards for content contributions?
 We’ll be launching various community activities and content creation contests very soon — with Jade rewards!
 The first campaign may go live as early as next week. Don’t miss it!

I live in Uzbekistan and wanted to order an ARO device, but there is no delivery to this country. What should I do?
Sorry, due to varying business demands, some regions don’t have open channels to purchase ARO Pods. I suggest you start by running the ARO Client first.
