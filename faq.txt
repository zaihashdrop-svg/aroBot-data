Are tokenomics available? | Tokenomics will be announced later — stay tuned! However, 5% of the total token supply is allocated for all Jade distributions to the community before TGE. | 
Can one IP support multiple nodes? | Yes, one IP can support multiple nodes. Ensure your upload speed can handle it. Rewards depend on bandwidth and performance. An ARO Pod supports up to 100 Mbps. | 
Why hasn’t my ARO Lite node earned anything after running for an hour? | Rewards are calculated hourly. If your network is stable, you should start seeing rewards within 1–2 hours. Frequent disconnects or IP changes may delay rewards. | 
Why am I online, but my node shows low rewards? | Only a small fraction of your bandwidth is used to test network connectivity. Current rewards displayed are virtual and for reference only. | 
Which port is the ARO Client listening to? | Documentation will be updated soon — please check back. | 
My node doesn’t show up / says "not added" — what should I do? | Mobile browsers with extensions may not be supported. Support is in progress — stay tuned! | 
Is there a tutorial for running the ARO Client node? | Yes! You can find the full guide here: ARO Docs – Software Setup | https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup
How can I add more nodes? | Node rewards depend on bandwidth. Multiple networks (separate IPs or ISPs) can deploy multiple nodes bound to your account. | 
Does adding more nodes increase my Jade and points? | During Previewnet, multiple ARO Pods under one account earn more Jades. Future phases: rewards scale with bandwidth and contribution quality. | 
Open ports for different nodes? | Explanations for ARO Lite/Pod and ARO Link/Client open ports are in their User Guides. | https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup
Why can't I connect to ARO Lite on my phone? | ARO Lite is not fully optimized for mobile browsers. Use desktop for best experience. Mobile compatibility is in progress. | 
How to install node in my MAC/Windows/Linux? | ARO Client is for X86 architectures; focus on Linux. Use a virtual machine: https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup/ Community tutorial reference: https://youtu.be/JDxlfBEEvIE | https://docs.aro.network/user-guides/software-setup/
Lite node disconnection | Remove the current plugin and reinstall latest version 0.0.4. Browser → Extensions → toggle ARO Lite off/on to reconnect. | 
Why is there so much difference between node lite and node pro? | Very limited impact on your internet experience for lite node. | 
What is the Redeem Code for, and when will I get one? | Redeem codes will be used in future campaigns and events. They’ll be released soon. | 
Is there a limit to how much Jade you can earn per day? | Depends on referrers. Example: buying 10 pods earns more Jade, referring 1,000 people earns more. | 
After manually downloading version 0.0.6, what happens to old serial number with accumulated Jades? | PreviewJade is virtual. Old data exists but only real mining starts at Testnet. | 
How can I earn rewards for content contributions? | Community activities and content contests will reward Jade. First campaign may go live soon. | 
I live in Uzbekistan and wanted to order an ARO device, but there is no delivery. What should I do? | Some regions don’t have open channels to purchase ARO Pods. Start by running the ARO Client first. |
